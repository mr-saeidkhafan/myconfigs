# my configs backup

	- awesome window manager config file and theme config
	- pacman packages
	- python packages (pip)
	- tmux config
	- vimrc file
	- custom patched dmenu

## vpn folder
	- redirect tor browser socks5 port to fake resocks port
	- iptables redirects fake redsocks port to all network ports (80, 443, ...)
	
	config.sh which has configs of iptables to handle redsocks ports.
	reset.sh for reseting iptables redirects (when you don't need proxy).
	start.sh starting the redsocks with -c (config file /etc/redsocks.conf).

	i also added shortcuts for running .sh files in bashrc file.


### these are my custom configs and feel free to use it
